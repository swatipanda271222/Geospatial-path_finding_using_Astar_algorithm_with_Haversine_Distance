# 🌐 Geospatial path finding using A* Algorithm with Haversine Distance 


**Geospasial Path Finding** is a Python project that helps navigate the shortest route between major cities in Egypt using the A* (A-Star) algorithm combined with the Haversine formula for accurate real-world distance. The interface is built using Tkinter and provides a visual map output using Folium.
